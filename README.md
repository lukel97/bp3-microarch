Exploration of the microarchitecture on the banana pi 3

The source in this repo is a not terrible interesting, it's simply a set
of simple scripts for generating and managing simply assembly test
programs for exploring micro architectural proposerties of the banana
pi 3.  This code is intended for *exploration*, there are much better
frameworks available for a true exhaustive search.  See e.g. microprobe
or llvm-exegensis.
